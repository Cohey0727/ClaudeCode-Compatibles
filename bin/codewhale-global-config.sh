# Register every configured provider in Codewhale's global config
# (`make codewhale-global`). A bare
# `codewhale` reads the generated ~/.codewhale/config.toml, and every provider
# in it is offered there.
#
# Everything comes from configs.jsonc. This is the one generated config that
# carries the keys themselves, and it is written at 600 because of it: the only
# indirection Codewhale offers a provider is `api_key_env`, which it resolves
# from the process environment alone — not from any file — so a reference would
# leave every provider unusable unless the surrounding shell already exported
# it. Re-run after rotating a key.
#
# Codewhale ships a provider catalog of its own, and an entry it does not
# recognise has to declare itself custom. A provider declared here therefore
# takes a route id of its own — one per API its models speak — says which wire
# protocol it speaks, and declares its models in full.
